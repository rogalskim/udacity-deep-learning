# udacity_dl_sagemaker
Final project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. The goal is to deploy a sentiment classification model using Amazon SageMaker, accompanied by a simple webpage. It should enable users to send the text of a movie review and in return receive a classification for it as either positive or negative.
